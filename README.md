## Android Malware detection

The mint tool as the early design focused on creating a user interface to help investigator to view and analysis malware scoure code. It contains a relatively simple malware detection scheme using april associated rules algorithm and 81 permission as features. Check associationRule.csv and permission_feature.csv for features used in this project. 
Note: Au et al.'s research provide us a mapping between 18251 documented APIs and 81 permissions across different Android versions (Check permission_mapping_API.csv). Since mint tool contains a functionality that fast locate API in the source code from permission, thus the detection is limited by using 81 features instead of using 151 most commonly used permissions.

CAPIL is the continued research aiming to achieve a better performance on malware detection. It is mainly based on decision tree algorithm and selected APIs. The idea behind the selection is to measure the an API's use case and select those APIs that has major differect usage in malware and benign applications. For detail information please check CAPIL paper. CAPIL contains tree experiments which are save in *.arff files, One could open them by weka tookit(http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html) and replicate these experiments: 

1. CAPIL approach: wholeSet.arff file contains 18518 samples 671 API features found in those samples. The API features are valued from 0 to 15 extracted by CAPIL representing the usage location. 
2. AIP based apporach: API_based_WholeSetArffFilePath.arff contains same number of sample and same feature names. The API feature value are binary in which 0 represent unused and 1 represent used.
3. Permission based approach: permission_based_additionalArffFilePath.arff contains same number of sample and 151 most commonly used permissions.

Note: CAPIL approach only consider those API required permissions. API features are limited by Au et al.'s research results which has 18251 document APIs. In which, 671 of them are found in training samples and used as feature.


The source code could be run in eclipse 4.4.1 environment.
