## Android Malware detection


### Component-API Linkage for Android Malware Detection (CAPIL)

CAPIL is our methodology in android malware detection. On top of API based detection approah which use API as binary features represent the API usage of a target sample, our approach bring in additional essential information: where is the API used in the target sample.

We used four andorid application components (activity, content provider, service and broadcast receiver) to group API indicating four different location and purpose. The decision tree model is trained on this feature and yeild 98.84% accury and 96.98% AUROC.
please check our research paper in component-api-linkage.pdf for detail.

### Implementation and test

This is a code implementation to support our research. It include feature extraction, feature ranking and selection, model training and three experiment. Test and compare our feature ranking algorithm, test and compare our model, combine feature ranking scheme hieratically. Please check main.py for more detail.

#### Requirement
